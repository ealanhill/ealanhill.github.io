	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>This past weekend I went to an event hosted by a local App Development Agency. It was a great time and, while there, I ran into a college student who brought his college’s computer club. He asked me if I had any thoughts on how to teach his fellow students programming. It was a great question to ask an experienced engineer, and I figured I would share some of the advice I gave him here, but specifically about Android.</p>

<h5>Books</h5>

<p>One of the most obvious ways to learn anything: pick up a book. Initially, this is how I started to learn Android development. I grabbed a book, started to read through it and work the examples.</p>

<p>The great thing about learning through books is you can learn at your own pace. You can take your time reading or you can speed read. You also get to keep the book forever as a reference, that’s what I did with my book. There are also a great variety of books written, so you can find one that suits your learning style.</p>

<p>The downside about books is how fast they fall behind the pace of technology. I have a book sitting on my bookcase about Javascript and JQuery, but the current push in the web development world seems to be Redux (you hardly hear about JQuery jobs lately). This time lag is obviously due to how long it takes to write and publish a book. So, if you are going to choose a book, make sure it was published recently (not a year ago).</p>

<h5>Bootcamps</h5>

<p>If you are looking the learn Android quickly, then perhaps a Bootcamp is for you. Bootcamps are courses put together by experts in the field and usually last about the week. They aim to teach you the bare minimum to get you started as an Android Developer and you are expected to have some minimum knowledge of Java before starting.</p>

<p>The difficulty with Bootcamps is that they usually don’t go in depth with the inner workings of Android. They will point you in the right direction, but won’t tell you about things like the Dex limit or Multidexing (things very important to an Android Developer).</p>

<p>When looking for a Bootcamp, check to ensure they teach you through projects and that there is a large project you add to throughout your time there. This helps you showcase what you can do to future employers and aids in learning Android.</p>

<h5>Project</h5>

<p>Do you have an app you wish someone would make? Well, make it yourself! The best way to learn anything is to just do it. Yes, you will make a lot of mistakes and it may be frustrating at times, but there’s plenty of resources out there to help you. People have written numerous blogposts about the different techniques you can use to implement your app.</p>

<p>True, your app may not be the best, but it is definitely going teach you a lot. You can also use the project to showcase your abilities, helping you land a job with other Android Developers.</p>

<h5>Go Learn</h5>

<p>Hopefully, these tips help to give you an idea on where you can start learning Android. So, go learn! Being willing to make mistakes and learn from them. Feel free to reach out for help.</p>

	  <title>Is A ScrumMaster Necessary</title>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>I have worked within the Agile framework since my first internship. I really like it’s fluidity, ability to adapt to changing requirements, and flexible structure. Recently, I started working with a client who has strictly implemented the Agile method, including a position I had not encountered previously. I had heard about it, but no company I have worked with has actually given someone this position as their sole role.</p>

<p>What is this position? Well, the person is a ScrumMaster.</p>

<p>As I’ve been working with this client, I noticed something very odd: the ScrumMaster hasn’t added any value to the team. Instead, he seems to enforce a process, which is something Agile is meant to avoid. This, in turn, seems to have dramatically hindered the team from delivering a product.</p>

<p>This situation has made me ask: Does Agile Scrum require a ScrumMaster?</p>

<h5>What is Scrum?</h5>

<p>First, Agile Scrum is a specific Agile framework for completing complex projects, according to the Scrum Alliance. Very vague…</p>

<p>The Scrum Alliance does provide a little more description of what Scrum includes. There must be a Product Owner, who creates a wish list of product requirements, which become the backlog. The team then works on a small portion of the backlog in Sprints, which last 2-4 weeks. Scrum includes daily stand ups to assess progress and roadblocks. Finally, at the end of a sprint, Scrum aims to have a shippable product for the Product Owner to review. This all sounds like normal Agile processes.</p>

<h5>What is a ScrumMaster?</h5>

<p>Within Scrum, what is a ScrumMaster? Well, they are the facilitator for the Agile Team, responsible for ensuring the Scrum process is understood and enacted. They ensure external interactions are only beneficial to the team. Scrum.org has a long list of other responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lead by example</li>
  <li>safe environment</li>
  <li>facilitate consensus</li>
  <li>read the room</li>
  <li>be patient</li>
  <li>don’t solve</li>
  <li>be comfortable with failure</li>
  <li>care for people</li>
  <li>low tolerance for impediments</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s a lot of things for one person, which cannot be easily measured in an individual.</p>

<p>But, looking over this list, they look a lot like another list of responsibilities for a different position: Project Manager.</p>

<h5>What are Project Managers?</h5>

<p>Doing a quick Google search, a  Project Manager is the person in charge of a project. It is their job to plan the project and determine it’s budget. Overall, their job is to the lead the project to the desired conclusion.</p>

<p>So, if a Project Managers main role is to be the project leader, then they too must</p>

<ul>
  <li>lead by example</li>
  <li>provide a safe environment</li>
  <li>read the room</li>
  <li>be patient</li>
  <li>don’t solve</li>
  <li>be comfortable with failure</li>
  <li>care for people</li>
  <li>low tolerance for impediments</li>
</ul>

<p>The only responsibility a ScrumMaster is supposed to do that is not on the above list is “facilitate consensus”. But is this really necessary? Wouldn’t leading by example cover this? Don’t Project Managers want people to work together? Wouldn’t that require a consensus?</p>

<p>Basically, I’m saying a Project Manager does everything a ScrumMaster does, with one added benefit, they have a stake in the results of the project. They are the person ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the project.</p>

<h5>Is a ScrumMaster Needed?</h5>

<p>No, I don’t believe a ScrumMaster is needed on every team.</p>

<p>What do I mean? Well, if a team is just starting to transition to an Agile process, then they might require a dedicated ScrumMaster. This way, there is someone on the team who can guide them through the change, to simplify the transition and help with any questions the team might have.</p>

<p>However, if the team is well established, or there are people who have experience with Agile, then there is no reason to have a full time ScrumMaster on the team. They become a drain of team, and therefore company, resources.</p>

<p>I’ve noticed the majority of software companies use the Agile process these days. Which means, a majority of software engineers are already familiar with Agile. So, let’s get rid of this old role and replace it with someone who is a true leader: the Project Manager.</p>

	  <title>Are Instant Apps The Future</title>

	     <p>As everyone should know in the Android developer community, Google released the Instant App SDK for companies to start adding them to their apps. For those who are not in the loop, Instant Apps are small versions of your app users download from a link on the internet. They last just as long as they need to on the users phone. But, I’m not going to rehash Instant Apps here, there are plenty of other articles out there <a href="https://willowtreeapps.com/ideas/an-introduction-to-android-instant-apps">explaining what they are</a>. Instead, I’m asking the question: Are Instant Apps the future of mobile apps?</p>

<h5>Why are Instant Apps important?</h5>

<p>Think for a moment, how do you find a company that meets your needs? How do you find that great bakery near your house? How do you find the movie times in your area? How do you find the best price for that table you are looking to buy? I’m willing to be it’s all done through a Google search.</p>

<p>More so today than before, people are finding things through the internet and every smartphone has a connection to the internet. This is where Google was very smart in how you download an Instant App. They decided to serve them to users via a link from an internet search. This allows people to discover your company’s app much faster than before. You don’t have to go to the Play Store to download the app, it’s just there…instantly.</p>

<h5>They don't take up storage</h5>

<p>One of the greatest things about Instant Apps is that they do not take up space on your phone. This means your users will have more storage on their device for their photos. Now, you will need to persist data through either the cloud, but don’t worry Google is currently working on a way to save data to the phone in a sort of cookie.</p>

<h5>Fully Android compatible</h5>

<p>With Instant Apps, you get full access to all the Android features. When your user clicks on a button to view a map, Google Maps will open up within the Instant App. Your users won’t need to switch to a new app, they stay within the Instant App, giving them a clean user experience.</p>

<h5>The Future</h5>

<p>So taking this three things into account: 1) easy access to your company’s app, 2) minimal storage foot print, and 3) full access to Android Features, it is quite possible we will see more Instant Apps in the future. With them, it is so easy to direct users to your app via a simple Google search, driving conversions. Also, no need for users to swap between apps to access or download the apps. Finally, no need to take up space on the users phone. So, again, I believe we will see a rise in Instant Apps in the coming years.</p>
